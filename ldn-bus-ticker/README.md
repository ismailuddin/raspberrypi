Raspberry Pi project to display the latest bus arrivals for a given bus stop in London on a Hitachi HD44780 based 16x2 character LCD.

This project is detailed at [scienceexposure.com](http://wp.me/p5wMDR-76) with diagrams.

## Notes
* The default set up is for Raspberry Pi model B+, where pin 21 is in renamed to pin 27. If you're using an older Pi, simply change 27 to 21 on line 13.
